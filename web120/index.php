    <p>Greetings and salutations.  Welcome to my portal page for Web Authoring at Seattle Central Community College.  I am studying design 
        and development for web authoring, databases, and software. With each new language and concept I explore, I am discovering a passion for 
        design and coding. I am excited for more.</p>

    <h3>About The Photos</h3>

    <p>The photos were taken at Kubota Garden, a 20-acre Japanese garden in the Rainier Beach neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. 
        A public park since 1987, it was started in 1927 by Fujitaro Kubota, a Japanese emigrant. Today, it is maintained as a public 
        park by the Seattle Parks and Recreation and the Kubota Garden Foundation.</p>
