       <p>Greetings and salutations.  Welcome to my portal page for Web Authoring at Seattle Central Community College.  I am studying design and development for web authoring, databases, and software. As my IT toolkit expands, I am finding that my love for design and coding growing as well. With only a taste of the possibilities, my excitement magnifies with each new piece that falls into place. </p>

       <h3>About The Photos</h3>

       <p>The photos were taken at Kubota Garden, a 20-acre Japanese garden in the Rainier Beach neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. A public park since 1987, it was started in 1927 by Fujitaro Kubota, a Japanese emigrant. Today, it is maintained as a public park by the Seattle Parks and Recreation and the Kubota Garden Foundation.</p>
