            <p>After 25 years in the beauty industry, I decided it was time for a change. I left my shears and shampoo capes behind and began my education anew. This web site is the culmination of my web development journey thus far. From the navigation bar to the articles within to the color of the text, these pages are what I have learned in just eight weeks. My journey has only just begun and I am excited for what I will be able to do in a year.</p>

            <p>As well as web authoring, I am also studying database design and software development. I will continue my education at Seattle Central College, working to become a full stack developer with a heavy lean toward databases and web development. From hairburner to tech geekâ€¦ who would have thought?</p>
