    <p>No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny. Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know. I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. Brave heart, Clara. You are the only mystery worth solving. Bow ties are cool. I never know why. I only know who. Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey?

I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard!</p>
